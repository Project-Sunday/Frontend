What is Angular?
Angular is a framework for building modern single-page applications. Makes complex code more managable,
without having to reinvent the wheel.
New version every six months.

Single-page vs traditional application?
Traditional loads full page on request, vs partial update.

- Most Angular developers use TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript/ECMAScript. TypeScript is strongly typed with compile-time checking, with IDE support, Angular is written in TypeScript. Can use JavaScript, ECMAScript, Dart.

- VS Code has built-in support for TypeScript. Typescript compiling to JavaScript code is 'transpiling'.

	- 'tsc mycode.ts' --> 'mycode.js'
	- Run the JavaScript code 'node mycode.js'
